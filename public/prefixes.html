        <!-- Definition -->

        <h1 class="mt-32 text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">Prefixes</h1>

        <p class="mt-10">Prefixes come at the beginning of a word. They are usually one to three letters long, and attaching them to a word will affect the word’s meaning. Some prefixes even combine with other prefixes to create words such as unpremeditated (un+ pre+
            meditated).
        </p>

        <h1 class="font-bold mt-20">Negative prefixes</h1>
        <p class="mt-10"><span class="font-bold">Dis-</span> means not, absence of, apart, away, or having a reversing force. Since dis- means not, what does disoriented mean? It’s pretty simple when you know the prefix.</p>
        <p class="mt-5"><span class="font-bold">Mis- and mal-</span> mean wrong or bad and are sometimes used for negation. Besides the common mistake, these prefixes also introduce the words misaligned, misfit, malformed, and malfunction.</p>
        <p class="mt-5"><span class="font-bold">Im- and its variant in-</span> mean not. Think impossible, impregnable, incapable, inconceivable.</p>
        <p class="mt-5"><span class="font-bold">Un- </span>also means not. It is a very common prefix seen in words such as unstoppable, unconquered, and unrestrained. In fact, there are quite a few prefixes that mean not. Don’t forget il- as in illogical and ir- as
            in irreversible.</p>


        <h1 class="font-bold mt-20">The Overachievers</h1>
        <p class="mt-10"><span class="font-bold">Extra-</span> is not just a brand of gum. As a prefix, it means beyond. Extraterrestrials live beyond the boundaries of our earth. Extrasensory perception refers to receiving information beyond what your senses would normally
            detect.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">Superman illustrates the prefix <span class="font-bold">super- </span>to a tee. Didn’t he go above and beyond to save lives?</p>


        <h1 class="font-bold mt-20">The Weights and Balances</h1>
        <p class="mt-10">Lots of prefixes clue us in on size. Especially large things are described with prefixes like <span class="font-bold">mega- and macro-</span> while small things are <span class="font-bold">micro- or mini-</span>. That information can help you
            to buy electronics: Would you prefer a minicomputer or one with more megabytes?</p>
        <p class="mt-5"><span class="font-bold">Equi-</span> means equal, as in equidistant. The <span class="font-bold">semi-</span> of semigloss paint lets you know that it is only partially glossy.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">Other prefixes indicate quantity like <span class="font-bold">over-</span> (excess) and <span class="font-bold">under-</span> (insufficiency).</p>




        <!-- Suffixes -->

        <h1 class="mt-32 text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">Suffixes</h1>

        <p class="mt-10">You find suffixes at the ends of words. Like prefixes, they are a rich source of information about a word. Have you ever seen blue or pink balloons at a baby shower? Some parents use colors to indicate the sex of their new baby. In the same way,
            some suffixes announce what part of speech a word is. Here are some examples.
        </p>

        <h1 class="font-bold mt-20">Noun</h1>
        <p class="mt-10">The following suffixes are usually found at the end of nouns: <span class="font-bold">-ance, -ation, -ness, -ism, -ment, -ship</span>.</p>

        <p class="mt-5">Other suffixes with this meaning are <span class="font-bold">-ize, -ise, -ify, and -en</span>. What verbs do you know that end with these suffixes?</p>


        <h1 class="font-bold mt-20">Verb</h1>
        <p class="mt-10">There are several suffixes associated with the meaning to make. By combining the baseactive with the suffix <span class="font-bold">-ate</span>, you create the word activate, which means to make active.</p>

        <p class="mt-5">Superman illustrates the prefix <span class="font-bold">super- </span>to a tee. Didn’t he go above and beyond to save lives?</p>


        <h1 class="font-bold mt-20">Adverb</h1>
        <p class="mt-10">In the majority of cases, adverbs are formed by adding <span class="font-bold">-ly</span> to an adjective. For instance, beautiful becomes beautifully. If the adjective already ends with a y as in easy, you would replace the y with <span class="font-bold">-ily</span>            to form the adverb easily. There is a special rule for adjectives ending in <span class="font-bold">-able, -ible, or -le</span>: replace the -e with -y. For most words ending in <span class="font-bold">-ic</span> (with the exception of public)
            add <span class="font-bold">-ally</span></p>

        <h1 class="font-bold mt-20">Adjective</h1>
        <p class="mt-10">Brownish is a color strongly reminiscent of brown, but not quite brown. People have a lot of fun with <span class="font-bold">-ish</span> because it means similar. You may even hear someone use this suffix alone in response to a question. Sally
            and Peter are dating, aren’t they? …Ish! The slang use of the suffix means “something like that.”</p>

        <p class="mt-5"><span class="font-bold">-Al, -ar, -ed, -ic, -ical, and -ive</span> signify having the quality of. Magnetic objects, for example, have qualities of magnets.</p>


        <p class="mt-5">The <span class="font-bold">-ous</span> of dangerous means full of or like, while <span class="font-bold">-less</span> -less means without.</p>
