        <!-- Definition -->

        <p class="mt-32">An introduction for an essay or research paper is the first paragraph, which explains the topic and prepares the reader for the rest of the work. Because it’s responsible for both the reader’s first impression and setting the stage for the rest
            of the work, the introduction paragraph is arguably the most important paragraph in the work. </p>


        <!-- 1 -->

        <h1 class="mt-32 text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">Definition</h1>

        <p class="mt-10">Your introduction is a way of preparing your reader for your paper. As the first paragraph of your writing, it makes the first impression and sets the reader’s expectations for tone, voice, and writing style. More importantly, your introduction
            provides the necessary background for your reader to understand your paper’s purpose and key points. </p>

        <p class="mt-10">The introduction is also a way to engage and captivate your reader. An interesting, thought-provoking, or generally entertaining introduction makes your reader excited to keep reading—and an eager reader is an attentive reader. </p>

        <!-- 2 -->


        <h1 class="mt-32 text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">What to include in an introduction</h1>
        <p class="mt-10">Introductions generally follow the writing style of the author and the format for the type of paper—for example, opening with a joke is appropriate for some essays, but not research papers. However, no matter what your writing style is or what
            kind of paper you’re writing, a good introduction includes at least three parts: </p>

        <p class="mt-10 italic">1. A hook to capture the reader’s attention
            <br>
            <br> 2. Background for context
            <br>
            <br> 3. A clearly defined thesis statement or main point of your paper</p>

        <h1 class="mt-32 text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">How to write an introduction paragraph in 6 steps</h1>


        <p class="mt-20 font-bold">1. Decide on the overall tone and formality of your paper</p>
        <p class="mt-10">Often what you’re writing determines the style: The guidelines for how to write an introduction for a report are different from those for how to write an English essay introduction. Even the different types of essays have their own limitations;
            for example, slang might be acceptable for a personal essay, but not a serious argumentative essay. </p>

        <p class="mt-20 font-bold">2. Write your thesis statement </p>
        <p class="mt-10">At the beginning of writing a paper, even before writing the research paper outline, you should know what your thesis is. If you haven’t already, now is the time to put that thesis into words by writing your thesis statement. </p>

        <p class="mt-20 font-bold">3. Consider what background information your reader needs </p>
        <p class="mt-10">Don’t take your own experience for granted. By this point in the writing process, you’ve probably already finished your research, which means you’re somewhat of an expert on the topic. Think back to what it was like before you learned: What did
            you wish you had known then? </p>

        <p class="mt-20 font-bold">4. Think of a good hook</p>
        <p class="mt-10">Writing a hook can be the most difficult part of writing an introduction because it calls for some creativity. While the rest of your paper might be presenting fact after fact, the hook in your introduction often requires creating something from
            nothing. </p>

        <p class="mt-20 font-bold">5. Write a rough draft of your introduction without pressure</p>
        <p class="mt-10">It’s normal to clam up when writing a rough draft of your introduction. After all, the introduction always comes first, so it’s the first thing you write when you finally begin. </p>


        <p class="mt-20 font-bold">6. Revise your introduction after you’ve written your whole paper.</p>
        <p class="mt-10">I recommend finishing the first draft of your entire paper before revising the introduction. You may make some changes in your paper’s structure when writing the first draft, and those changes should be reflected in the introduction.</p>





        <h1 class="mt-32 text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">Example</h1>


        <h1 class="mt-20 font-bold">Introduction for an essay example</h1>

        <p class="mt-10 italic">While other kids’ memories of circuses are happy and fun, what I recall most from my first time at a circus was feeling sorry for the animals—I can still remember the sadness in their eyes. <span class="font-bold">[HOOK]</span> Although animal
            rights in the circus have come a long way, their treatment of animals even under the new laws is still cruelty plain and simple. <span class="font-bold">[BACKGROUND]</span> The way circuses abuse animals needs to be abolished immediately,
            and we need to entirely rethink the way we use animals for entertainment. <span class="font-bold">[THESIS STATEMENT]</span> </p>


        <h1 class="mt-20 font-bold">Introduction for a research paper example</h1>

        <p class="mt-10 italic">What would happen to humanity if everyone just stopped having babies?<span class="font-bold">[HOOK]</span> Although more endemic in some places than others, the global decline in birth rates has become a major issue since the end of the pandemic.
            <span class="font-bold">[BACKGROUND]</span> My research here shows not only that birth rates are declining all over the world, but also that unless the threats are addressed, these drastic declines will only get worse. <span class="font-bold">[THESIS STATEMENT]</span>            </p>
