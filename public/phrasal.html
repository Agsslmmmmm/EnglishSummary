        <!-- Definition -->

        <p class="mt-32">Phrasal verbs are two or more words that together act as a completely new word, with a meaning separate from the original words. For example, pick up means to “grab” or “lift,” very different from the definitions of pick and up alone. Popular
            in spoken English, phrasal verbs can be quite confusing because their definitions aren’t always easy to guess—and there are thousands of them. In fact, many phrasal verbs are distinct variations on the same base verb, which can add to the
            confusion.</p>


        <!-- 1 -->

        <h1 class="mt-32 text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">Definition</h1>

        <p class="mt-10">A phrasal verb combines a normal verb with an adverb or a preposition to create an entirely new verbal phrase—the phrasal verb. The meaning of a phrasal verb is usually unrelated to the meanings of the words that comprise it, so think of a phrasal
            verb as an entirely new and independent word.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> When used in a sentence, phrasal verbs act the same as other verbs for conjugation and placement, although they do have special grammatical rules about word order, which we talk about below. Phrasal verbs can be conjugated into every
            type of verb form, so you can use them anywhere you could use a normal verb.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> Let’s look at the phrasal verb get over as an example. The verb get alone means to “acquire,” and the preposition over alone usually refers to being higher or going above something. However, put them together and the phrasal verb get
            over means to “recover” or “overcome,” a completely new definition that’s separate from the definitions of get and over.</p>
        <br>
        <br> You can use get over just like a normal verb, in any form or tense. Here are some quick examples:

        <p class="mt-10 italic"><span class="font-bold">Simple past tense: </span>
            <br> I had the flu last week but got over it.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="font-bold">Infinitive</span>
            <br> He wrote a song to get over his grandmother’s death.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="font-bold">Gerund</span>
            <br> Getting over prejudice at work is never easy.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="font-bold">Particle</span>
            <br> Having finally gotten over the breakup, they were ready to return their partner’s things. </p>

        <h1 class="mt-32 text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">Conjugate Pharasal</h1>
        <p class="mt-10">When a phrasal verb is used as the main verb of a sentence, you conjugate the verb part and leave the other words as they are. Simply use whatever form of the verb you would use if it were alone. </p>

        <p class="mt-10 italic">I get up at noon during the summer.
            <br>
            <br> However, this morning I got up at sunrise.
            <br>
            <br> I have gotten up early too many times this month. </p>


        <p class="mt-10">Notice how only the word get changes, but the word up remains the same. Also notice how get, an irregular verb, uses its irregular forms to fit whichever tense it needs. </p>

        <h1 class="mt-32 text-3xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">Types of Phrasal Verb</h1>


        <p class="mt-20">To better understand phrasal verbs, it helps to organize them into two pairs: transitive and intransitive; separable and inseparable. A phrasal verb can belong to only one of each pair (although all separable phrasal verbs are transitive). </p>

        <p class="mt-20 font-bold">1. Transitive Pharasal verb</p>
        <p class="mt-10">Transitive phrasal verbs use a direct object, just like normal transitive verbs.
            <p class="mt-5 italic">Charlie couldn’t put up with the meowing cats any longer. </p>

            <p class="mt-20 font-bold">2. Intransitive phrasal verbs</p>
            <p class="mt-10">Likewise, intransitive phrasal verbs do not use an object.
                <p class="mt-5 italic">The regional director was late, so the sales team went ahead without her. </p>

                <p class="mt-20 font-bold">3. Separable phrasal verbs</p>
                <p class="mt-10">With transitive phrasal verbs, you can sometimes put the direct object in between the words, for example, “pick you up.” There are, however, a few rules to follow with separable phrasal verbs, so pay attention to our next section about
                    word order.
                    <p class="mt-5 italic">He forgot to shut the lights off before he left. </p>

                    <p class="mt-20 font-bold">4. Inseparable phrasal verbs</p>
                    <p class="mt-10">Inseparable phrasal verbs cannot be split up and must be used together.
                        <p class="mt-5 italic">The wayward son carried on without his father. </p>
