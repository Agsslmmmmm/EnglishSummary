        <p class="mt-10">Investigate every picture as it is being taken</p>
        <p class="mt-5">hotographers should be reporters, too, and they should be expected to and prepared to gather information. Reporters shouldn't let photographers go out alone the job belongs to both of them, and they can be gathering more information while the
            photographer shoots things</p>

        <h1 class="font-bold mt-20">Step two</h1>
        <p class="mt-10">Reinvestigate each picture that will be used. </p>
        <p class="mt-5">1. Find out who is doing what in the picture <br>2. Find out what was going on before and after the picture was taken <br>3. Find out when and where the event took place and be able to explain why that might be important to the story of the year
            <br> 4. Find out why this event was taking place and how it represents all the other events of the year or why this event was special </p>

        <h1 class="font-bold mt-20">Step three</h1>
        <p class="mt-10">Set aside time (5-10 minutes is good) to talk to the people in the photograph </p>
        <p class="mt-5"><span class="font-bold">DO NOT</span> : <br>1. ask for a quote!!! <br>2. tell them you want to interview them. <br>3. expect them to give you the best story ever if you give them less than 10 seconds to think about it. </p>
